The tracking was achieved by determining by the transmission time of signals (from the source ie a tracker carried by the shopper) to the receivers (located on shopping cart). The transmission was coordinated and timed by a microcontroller on the cart and was initiated by radio signals.

The following illustration shows how it worked.
